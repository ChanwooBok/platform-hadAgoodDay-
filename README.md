# Had A Good Day 🌞
*A full-stack web application built with React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL*

---

## 📌 Overview
This project was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to design and develop a complete web application independently.  
The goal was to build a scalable platform where users can browse, paginate, and interact with products.

I approached this project as if it were a real-world internship:  
- Defined requirements and architecture myself  
- Made trade-offs between technologies  
- Documented challenges and solutions  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), React Router, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL  
- **Validation:** Zod  
- **Tooling:** GitHub  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Server-side Data Loading** with React Router loaders  
- **Pagination** for scalable product listings  
- **Reusable UI Components** (Hero section, ProductCard, Pagination)  
- **Responsive Design** with Tailwind CSS  
- **Type-Safe Validation** using Zod

## 💡 Key Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Efficient Data Loading
- **Challenge:** Avoid overfetching and maintain performance as data grows.  
- **Solution:** Implemented React Router loaders with server-side pagination.

### 2. Maintaining Type Safety
- **Challenge:** Ensuring API responses and parameters match TypeScript types.  
- **Solution:** Used **Zod** to validate inputs and outputs, catching errors early.

### 3. Reusability & Clean Code
- **Challenge:** Avoid repeating UI patterns.  
- **Solution:** Built reusable components (Hero, ProductCard, Pagination) and structured the project with scalability in mind.
